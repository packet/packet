/*
 * Since wangle primitives (promise/future) are not thread safe, it is difficult
 * to build complex asynchronous workflows. A Later allows you to build such a
 * workflow before actually launching it so that continuations can be set in a
 * threadsafe manner.
 *
 * The interface to add additional work is the same as future: a then() method
 * that can take either a type T, a Future<T>, or a Later<T>
 *
 * Thread transitions are done by using executors and calling the via() method.
 *
 * Here is an example of a workflow:
 *
 * Later<ClientRequest> later(std::move(request));
 *
 * auto future = later.
 *   .via(cpuExecutor)
 *   .then([=](Try<ClientRequest>&& t) { return doCpuWork(t.value()); })
 *   .via(diskExecutor)
 *   .then([=](Try<CpuResponse>&& t) { return doDiskWork(t.value()); })
 *   .via(serverExecutor)
 *   .then([=]Try<DiskResponse>&& t) { return sendClientResponse(t.value()); })
 *   .launch();
 *
 * Although this workflow traverses many threads, we are able to string
 * continuations together in a threadsafe manner.
 *
 * Laters can also be used to wrap preexisting asynchronous modules that were
 * not built with wangle in mind. You can create a Later with a function that
 * takes a callback as input. The function will not actually be called until
 * launch(), allowing you to string then() statements on top of the callback.
